            <h2>My name is John and living the simple life saved my life</h2>
            <p><strong>The room she wanted</strong> had wall paper on it that needed to go. It was bubbling and super easy to take down. It peeled off just like skin from a sun burn, very satisfying. I would put it back up just to peel it back off. It was that much fun taking it down.</p>
            <p>We kept her bed we just purchased 2 years ago from Wayfair. She picked out new bedding and a few things to put on the walls and around her room</p>

            <h3>How I turned things around</h3>
            <p><strong>Rock that Vintage</strong>  installed the shiplap. Check them out if you are local to the East Valley. This is the third project they have done for us and they are amazing at what they do!!.</p>
            <p>She also needed a new dresser. Her old dresser didn’t work well. My husband’s dad had an antique dresser that worked great just needed to be repainted and new hardware.</p>

            <h3>Now I live the simple life</h3>
            <p><strong>We had 5 days</strong>  to explore and left on Sunday morning. We drove to Kanab, Utah (6 hours) and went straight to the Coral Pink Sand Dunes. This was the warmest I would put it back up just to peel it back off. It was that much fun taking it down.</p>
            <p>If you go on a windy day, wear pants or the sand feels like tiny little needles when you get hit!</p>
